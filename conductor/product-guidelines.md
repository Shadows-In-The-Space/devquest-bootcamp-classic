# Product Guidelines - DevQuest Bootcamp

## Visual Identity (Neon-Cyberpunk)
- **Palette:** Strictly adhere to `#bf40ff` (Brand Purple) for primary highlights and `#32D74B` (Brand Green) for success states and accent highlights.
- **Imagery:** Use high-contrast images of workstations, hardware, and stylized game-dev environments.
- **UI Elements:** Incorporate glowing "neon" shadows, grid background patterns, and sharp cornered containers (rounded-xl) to maintain the "tech-heavy" gaming aesthetic.
- **Theming:** Ensure perfect legibility in both light and dark modes, with dark mode being the "canonical" experience for developers.

## Prose & Messaging
- **Voice:** Direct, challenging, and high-energy.
- **Copy Standards:**
    - Use active verbs ("Build", "Code", "Master").
    - Incorporate gaming terminology (Level up, XP, Quest, Rank).
    - Avoid corporate jargon; speak as one developer to another.
- **Tone Example:** "Stop hiding behind engines. Master the GPU pipeline and build the technology that others only use."

## Brand Messaging
- **Core Value Prop:** "Technical Mastery through Intensity."
- **Brand Taglines:** "Rendering Level-Up", "Baue echte Spiele", "Deep Dive Engineering".
