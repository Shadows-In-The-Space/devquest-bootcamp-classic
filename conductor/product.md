# Initial Concept
A high-fidelity landing page for a Game Development Bootcamp featuring light/dark mode, responsive design, and neon aesthetics using Tailwind CSS.

# Product Definition - DevQuest Bootcamp

## Core Concept
DevQuest Bootcamp is a high-fidelity, gamified landing page designed to recruit aspiring game developers for an intensive, in-person graphics programming course. The site uses "DevQuest" metaphors—such as XP bars, player ranks, and level-up notifications—to create an engaging, high-energy environment that mirrors the excitement of game development itself.

## Target Audience
- **Aspiring Game Developers:** Individuals seeking to transition from high-level "black box" tools to deep, low-level graphics programming (Shader, Rendering, GPU Pipelines).

## Primary Goals
- **High-Conversion Lead Generation:** The primary success metric is the number of visitors who apply or request a consultation for the next bootcamp sprint.
- **Curriculum Transparency:** Providing a clear, module-by-module breakdown of the technical journey to build trust and set expectations.

## Key Features
- **Gamified HUD:** A persistent header/overlay that tracks user scroll progress as "XP", leveling the user up as they explore the curriculum.
- **Detailed Curriculum Map:** A deep dive into OpenGL and Vulkan modules, concluding with a "Capstone" mini-engine project.
- **Dynamic Theming:** A high-contrast light/dark mode system that emphasizes "Neon" aesthetics and high-performance engineering.

## Tone and Personality
- **Gamified & Manic:** The brand speaks the language of gamers and developers. It is energetic, utilizes gaming metaphors (Leveling, Ranks), and emphasizes the "Quest" of becoming a Graphics Engineer.
